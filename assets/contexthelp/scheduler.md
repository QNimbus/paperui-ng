<small>You know what an openHAB **Timed-Task** is, right?</small>
<small class="blockquote-footer">Your friendly [tutorial](tutorial-1.html) reminder.</small>

This section lists all configured timed-tasks.
It also lists scheduled tasks that are not configured directly by you,
but are dynamically created by *Rules* and *Scripts* or *Bindings*.

Add a *Timed-Task* by clicking on "Add *Timed-Task*" to your left in the navigation menu.
Remove a *Timed-Task* by clicking on the trash can icon next to its name.

A *Timed-Task* can have a very simple purpose like a "Weekday wake-up timer".
*Rules* and *Scripts* can create *Timed-Tasks* dynamically for example to
"switch off a lamp, 5 minutes after it has been switched on".

### Tags

Tags can be assigned to *Timed-Task*. You can filter this list by tags.

### Show timers in apps

The Android and iOS App as well as HabPanel will only show *Timed-Task* that are exposed.
