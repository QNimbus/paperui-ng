You can define user-roles.

A user can have specific access rights to openHAB subsystems
like persistence, configurations, inbox, things and so on.

You can also allow a user to just access "items" and then define
which items are accessible via a selection of specific items
and by regex patterns on the label and the ID. Items can also
be allowed by their Tags.
