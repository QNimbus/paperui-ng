<small>You know what an openHAB **Item** is, right?</small>
<small class="blockquote-footer">Your friendly [tutorial](tutorial-1.html) reminder.</small>

Find all your configured *Items* listed here.

Click the *Items* name to show or modify the storage association (e.g. filename),
see the <abbr title="The ID is used by Rules and Scripts">unique ID</abbr>, and change
the icon category.

## Icons

An *Item* can have an icon assigned that is used for presentation in some user interfaces.
For all available icons have a look at
[the classic icon theme](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/iconsets/classic/).

## Filter

Filter items by tags, types or groups. Examples:
* `groupNames`:`AwesomeGroup`
* `tags`:`Lighting`
* `type`:`Switch`

## Textual mode

Batch edit your data while using copy &amp; paste, regex find &amp; replace syntax highlighting, and auto-suggestions.

Synopsis:

* Whitespace indentation denotes the structure.
* Comments begin with the number sign (#).

* Express associative data in the form "key: value".

<mark>Please note</mark>: The textual mode is powerful.
Hit save with an emptied text field and everything is gone. Act responsible!

<summary>Storage</summary>

openHAB internally stores your data a little different than what you see 
here in the textual mode representation. The [backup service](maintenance.html) however
will create files that match this format and imports same-like files again.

Change the storage association to store the data item into a different
file.
