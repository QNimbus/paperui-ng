<small>You know what an openHAB **Channel** is, right?</small>
<small class="blockquote-footer">Your friendly [tutorial](tutorial-1.html) reminder.</small>

See all offered channels of this *Thing* listed here.

Generic bindings or bindings for devices that don't offer
complete auto-discovery also allow to add and remove
channels manually.

### Synchronize channels

When you upgrade a binding, for technical reasons or earlier design failures 
some channels are changing drastically.

openHAB cannot automatically upgrade those channels for you and
just keeps the "old" variants. Click on "Synchronize channels" to
remove unsupported channels and show new ones.
