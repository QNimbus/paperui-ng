        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <p>A rule consists of a <b>Name</b>, a unique <b>ID</b>, <b>Events</b>, <b>Conditions</b> and <b>Actions</b>.</p>

        <p>A binding or service, installed via the <i>Add-ons</i> screen, might add more Events, Conditions or Actions
            to the table.</p>

        <h5>Events</h5>
        <p>
            Defines the events when the Rule will trigger. This is optional if you are creating a Rule that is to be
            called from other Rules. You can create more than one trigger.
        </p>

        <p>Some triggers are part of the core installation:</p>

        <table class="table table-striped table-bordered" style="width: initial">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Trigger Type</th>
                    <th>What it does</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>a trigger channel fires</td>
                    <td>Triggers a Rule when a Channel trigger fires such as is used in the Dash Button binding or
                        Astro binding for astronomical events. Both the Channel and the event can be defined.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>an item state changes</td>
                    <td>Triggers the Rule when the
                        selected Item changes state. One can optionally define the previous state and new state.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>an item receives a command</td>
                    <td>Triggers the Rule when
                        the selected Item receives a command. One can optionally define the command received.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>an item state is updated</td>
                    <td>Triggers the Rule when the
                        selected Item receives an update. One can optionally define the update received.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>it is a fixed time of day</td>
                    <td>Sets the Rule to trigger at a specific time of day every day.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>the rule is activated</td>
                    <td>Triggers when a rule is activated the first time. This causes the Rule to trigger when it is
                        first loaded by OH.</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h5>Conditions</h5>
        <p>
            Defines the conditions under which the Rule will run when triggered. This is optional and there can be more
            than one condition.
        </p>

        <p>Some conditions are part of the core installation:</p>

        <table class="table table-striped table-bordered" style="width: initial">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Condition Type</th>
                    <th>What it does</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>an item has a given state</td>
                    <td>Select the Item, comparison operator, and the value to compare against. For example,
                        MyTemperature Item &gt;= (is greater or equal to) 20.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>a given script evaluates to true</td>
                    <td>A script to execute whose last line evaluates true or false. If the that line is true, the rule
                        will be allowed to run (assuming all the other defined conditions are also true). Currently
                        only JavaScript is supported. Everything available to the Action Script is available here as
                        well. The Script just needs to return true or false.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>it is a certain day of the week</td>
                    <td>Allows one to select the day of the week that it must be for the Rule to run. This combined
                        with “it is a fixed time of day” allows one to write Rules that trigger at a certain time on
                        certain days.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h5>Actions</h5>
        <p>
            Defines what actions the Rule takes when it runs. This is optional (though the Rule won’t do anything) and
            there can be more than one Action. Actions are performed in the order they are listed in the <i>Rule</i>.
        </p>

        <p>Some actions are part of the core installation:</p>

        <table class="table table-striped table-bordered" style="width: initial">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Action Type</th>
                    <th>What it does</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>send a command</td>
                    <td>Allows one to send a command to an Item when the Rule runs. This can be very useful for
                        creating links between proxy Items and device Items.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>run rules</td>
                    <td>Allows the triggering of other Rule(s) to run when this Rule triggers.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>enables or disable rules</td>
                    <td>Enable or disable Rule(s). This is useful to create “away
                        mode” type Rule sets as they can be enabled/disabled based on events.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>execute a given script</td>
                    <td>Define a <i>Script</i> to execute when the Rule runs.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>say something</td>
                    <td>Send Text-to-speech to the selected audio sink. The text is statically defined but you can
                        generate dynamic text in a script.</td>
