    <h4>Control interfaces</h4>

    <p>In this section you learn about the fun part of setting up your openHAB system - the user interface! This is the
      most
      rewarding part of your configuration, because youâ€™ll actually get to see real-time results of all your work until
      now, and interact with your home automation things directly via the user interface.</p>

    <h5>Widgets everywhere - HABpanel</h5>

    <img style="max-width: 60%;max-height: 100%;float:right;padding-right: 20px;" src="img/tutorial/habpanel.png">

    <p>HABpanel is a touch-friendly user interface for tablets. It layouts your Items via so called <b>Widgets</b>.</p>

    <p>Widgets are html with javascript snippets and can therefore express any design and functionality.
      We have a default set of Widgets for rendering our known Item types.
      The community also created dedicated Widgets for Spotify, Alexa, Weather services and so on.
    </p>

    <p>If you had nothing but computers and tablets controlling your home automation system,
      you could easily get away with only using HABpanel.</p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info mb-4">
      Caveat: You need to configure your HABpanel pages yourself, drag&drop Widgets, but also configure Widgets to do
      the Right Thing&trade;.
    </div>

    <p>Make sure you have installed HABpanel in the <a class="demolink" href="addons.html">Add-ons</a> section.</p>

    <h5>Dashboards - HABdashboard</h5>

    <img style="max-width: 60%;max-height: 100%;float:right;padding-right: 20px;" src="img/tutorial/basicui.png">

    <p>
      Widgets tend to use a lot of screen real-estate and often require configuration.
      For the phone screen and also for kickstarting your control needs, there is a better option.
    </p>

    <p>openHABs second solution for control interfaces are <b>Dashboards</b>.</p>

    <p>Dashboards define the layout and handling of items,
      and tell dashboard based user interfaces how to interact with your Items.
      You would use Dashboards to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Group Items per Room</li>
      <li>Use binding provided dashboard components.
        Those are compositions of related Items to form more complex controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info mb-4">
      Dashboards must be configured and layed out by you.
    </div>

    <p>openHAB provides a "dynamic" dashboard, that is auto-layouted and grouped by Things and Channels.
    </p>

    <p>Make sure you have installed HABdashboard in the <a class="demolink" href="addons.html">Add-ons</a> section.</p>

    <h5 style="clear: both">Android / iOS App</h5>

    <p>If you want to enjoy the native speed of your phone platform and a fluent,
      animated and integrated interface consider our mobile apps.
      Both Apps use Dashboards for displaying your Items.</p>
