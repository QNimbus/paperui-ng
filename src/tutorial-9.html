    <h4>Control interfaces</h4>

    <p>In this section you learn about the fun part of setting up your openHAB system - the user interface! This is the
      most
      rewarding part of your configuration, because you’ll actually get to see real-time results of all your work until
      now, and interact with your home automation things directly via the user interface.</p>

    <h5>Habpanel</h5>

    <img style="max-width: 60%;max-height: 100%;float:right;padding-right: 20px;" src="img/tutorial/habpanel.png">

    <p>Habpanel is the most touch-friendly and easily configurable user interface in openHAB, and it doesn’t require
      anything more than what you’ve done so far (that is, creating the Items for your Thing Channels). That is because
      Habpanel interfaces directly to the Items, using “Widgets”.</p>

    <p>There are many types of Widgets and they use Items to
      show things like the state of your HVAC system temperature, or to control the color of your lamp. If you had
      nothing but computers and touchpads controlling your home automation system, you could easily get away with only
      using Habpanel.</p>

    <p>Make sure you have installed Habpanel in the <a href="addons.html">Add-ons</a> section.</p>

    <h5 style="clear: both">Basic UI</h5>

    <img style="max-width: 60%;max-height: 100%;float:right;padding-right: 20px;" src="img/tutorial/basicui.png">

    <p>For the phone screen, there are much better options, like <b>Basic UI</b>.
      It does NOT interface directly to your <i>Items</i>, like Habpanel does.
      Instead, it depend on a configuration file called a “Sitemap”. Sitemaps define the layout and handling of
      items for the user interface, and tell the Basic UI how to interact with your Items.</p>

    <p>Make sure you have installed Basic UI in the <a href="addons.html">Add-ons</a> section.</p>

    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/sitemaps.html">Sitemaps</a> are created with
      <b>Habmin</b>.</p>

    <h5 style="clear: both">Android / iOS App</h5>

    <p>If you want to enjoy the native speed of your phone platform, consider our mobile apps.
      Both Apps use Sitemaps for displaying your Items.</p>
